# Long-term Caching for Immutable Assets (1 Year)
# Use a common prefix for all static assets for better clarity and less repetition.
# /assets/* and /_astro/* are where Astro puts most production assets.

/assets/*
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

/_astro/*

# Simplified Wildcard Matching for all common file types
# The syntax should be two lines (the path pattern, then the header)
# NOTE: The pattern for these file extensions must include a directory path if they are not in the root.
# For simplicity and effectiveness, we rely on the /assets/* and /_astro/* rules above
# since most Astro build outputs (JS, CSS, fonts, optimized images) go there.

# If you have static assets directly in the root (like favicon.ico or robots.txt)
