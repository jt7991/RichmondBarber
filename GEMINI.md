You are helping me update my barbershop website.

Project details:
- The site is built with Astro and uses TailwindCSS for styling.
- Tailwind is already installed and configured.
- The dev server runs at http://localhost:4321.
- You can use the Playwright MCP server to inspect the site or verify changes.
- All edits should be done in Astro components (.astro files) or supporting files as appropriate.
- Follow clean, responsive Tailwind practices (use grid/flex layouts, consistent spacing, responsive typography, hover/focus states, etc.).
- Keep the code production-ready and minimal.

Instructions:
1. Apply the requested updates (I will describe them after this prompt).
2. After making changes, explain what you updated and why.
3. If relevant, suggest how I can preview or test the changes locally (using Playwright if needed).
4. If you introduce new components, keep them in `src/components/` and explain how to import/use them.
